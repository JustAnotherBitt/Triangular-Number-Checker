# Triangular Number Checker

## Description
This Python program allows users to:
- Find the triangular number at a given position.
- Check if a given number is a triangular number.

Triangular numbers follow the formula:
\[ T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \]
Where \( T_n \) is the \( n \)-th triangular number.

## Features
- **Check a triangular number's position**: Enter a position, and the program returns the corresponding triangular number.
- **Verify if a number is triangular**: Input a number, and the program determines if it belongs to the triangular number sequence.
- **Interactive menu**: The user selects options through a simple interface.

## Usage
1. Run the Python script.
2. Choose one of the following options:
   - `1` to check the triangular number in a specific position.
   - `2` to verify if a given number is triangular.
   - `3` to exit the program.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions.

## Example Output
